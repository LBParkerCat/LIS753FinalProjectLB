						<p>Our Main sale offers adult books, CDs, DVDs, records, and magazines. Hardcover books start at $1.00 and paperback books start at $0.50. Main sale hours are <span style="color: blue;">11AM-4PM SAT & 1PM-4PM SUN</span>. The Main room faces East Charleston Rd: find it on our <a href="#roommap" alt="go to map of sale rooms">Sale room map</a>. Check out our <a href="#bargainsaleinfo" alt="go to bargain sale info">Bargain sale</a> for even better deals!</p>
						<p>If you want first crack on SAT, we use a ticketing system to ensure smooth traffic flow. We hand out up to 2 numbered tickets per person at the Main sale door, starting at 8AM.</p>
						<p>Your tickets reserve you places in line when the sale starts at 11AM. You are free to get coffee or check out our Children's and Bargain sales in the meantime. Just get back to the Main room a few minutes before 11AM: you'll forfeit your spot(s) if you're not present. No ticket, no problem! Just join the line and we'll let you in as soon as we can.</p>
						<p>We love our early shoppers, but during the first hour of the SAT sale there is a 12 book limit on purchases. You may rejoin the line to enter again. The 12 book limit remains in effect until there is no line</p>
						<p>Why the numbers and line and puchase limit? We care about your health and safety, and the size of our Main room limits occupancy to 160 people. Our ticketing system allows early shopping. Our line system and purchase limit allow walk-up customers access. Everybody wins, and so does the library!</p>

					<p>&#1F436 Jan loved the club so much that when she retired from university teaching out-of-state, she moved back to Illinois and came to meetings again</p>
					<p>&#1F30E Mary travels the world (you’ll be hard-pressed to name a country she hasn’t or isn’t planning to visit) with her family while consulting for non-profits and baking cookies…will never live down forgetting the holiday cookies</p>
					<p>&#x1f431 Joe isn’t sure what he’s gotten himself into. When he retired from teaching, his partner made him join a group. Wants to read more books…finds it easier to listen to audiobooks while walking. When he has something to say, it’s pithy and funny</p>
					<p>Jen -  sekptical technologist something</p>
					<p>Stephen practices the dark arts (cybersecurity) by day and dad jokes by night. His son pretends he’s funny, his cats are not amused. His lol is the reason the library asked us to book a study room for our meetings</p>
