						<p>Founded in 1999 in the cozy living room of one of its first members, the group began as a small circle of readers who loved sharing books and lively conversation. Over time, the club grew in spirit and purpose, eventually moving to a library setting to create a more welcoming, community-focused club. While it still enjoys a dedicated core membership, the group continues to look forward—inviting new readers to join, share their perspectives, and help shape the next chapter of its history.</p>
						<p>Come and be part of our next chapter!</p>	
					<!--Members-->
						<h2 id="members">Members</h2>
						<p>&#x1F436 Jan loved the club so much that when she retired from university teaching out-of-state, she moved back to Illinois and came to meetings again. Really dislikes Emma Bovary</p>
						<p>&#x1F30E Mary travels the world (you’ll be hard-pressed to name a country she hasn’t or isn’t planning to visit) with her family while consulting for non-profits and baking cookies…will never live down forgetting the holiday cookies</p>
						<p>&#x1f431 Joe isn’t sure what he’s gotten himself into. When he retired from teaching, his partner made him join a group. Wants to read more books…finds it easier to listen to audiobooks while walking. When he has something to say, it’s pithy and funny</p>
						<p>&#x1F3B5 Jen is a skeptical technologist and aspiring protagonist. Devoted daughter/wife/parent/friend. Volunteers in her neighborhood and sings in two choirs</p>
						<p>&#x1F47D Stephen practices the dark arts (cybersecurity) by day and dad jokes by night. His son pretends he’s funny, his cats are not amused. His lol is the reason the library asked us to book a study room for our meetings</p>
						<p>&#x1F337 Lisa is reinventing herself as a librarian after many years in the technology industry. In her spare time…well, she has no spare time between her library job and library school. She would like to be cooking, taking walks, and reading more</p>
						<p>&#x1F300 John collects rare books and has read many of the classic texts (and we mean classic…i.e. the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>) that we haven’t managed to read in our club yet. We may get to Mary Beard’s <i>SPQR</i></p>.
